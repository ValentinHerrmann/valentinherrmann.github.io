## General

**Beta Hosted at** [db.valentin-herrmann.com](https://db.valentin-herrmann.com) (Login required)

**Code at Github:**
[DataSpark](https://github.com/ValentinHerrmann/DataSpark) and Forks of
[Martin Pabst's SQL-IDE](https://github.com/ValentinHerrmann/DataSpark_SQL-IDE) powering the SQL editing, and
[TUM's Apollon Editor](https://github.com/ValentinHerrmann/DataSpark_Apollon) powering the database creation via class diagrams.


## Didactical Idea & Concept

In K-12 computer science education, students learn about spreadsheets and afterwards about databases. They often lack an understanding of use-cases where, at first glance, more complicated database systems have advantages over easier-to-use Excel spreadsheets. Some of these advantages are **separation of users and admins**, respectively, **backend and frontend**, and the possibility to provide specified **input forms to reduce the complexity** for the user. 

Additionally, most software for database creation is either too function-rich for educational use, expensive, or only available for specific desktop operating systems. Programs which were especially developed for education often lack the performance to provide wide walls and high ceilings for student projects. 

To tackle these problems, I started the development of Dataspark. An OS-independent web application providing pairs of user and admin accounts (in the future, multiple users will be possible) for a common database which can be accessed via SQLite (freely edited by the admin and provided to the user, allowing text input and dropdown menus whose options can be configured via SQL themselves).

|First opens the overview page of the initially empty database. UThe overview page allows to up- and download SQLite database files and the full project folder. |![abc](/dataspark/student_sample_0.png)|
